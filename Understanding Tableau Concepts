12. Differences between                DISCRETE and CONTINUOUS:
FORM:                      individually seperate | unbroken whole
FILTERED:                  filtered individually | in a range
NATURE:                    countable             | measureable
GENERALLY ADDS "" TO VIEW: header                | axes
BRINGS:                    level of detail       | aggregated number


13. STRING, BOOLEAN cannot be continuous
Can turn a discrete into a continous one; cannot sort continuous values


14. DISC & CONT BONUS
create a calculated field: 
IF SUM ([Quantity]) > 2000 THEN 'Good'
ELSE 'Bad'
END


15. Aggregation
By default, Tableau aggregates measures, so we can disable it by Analysis > Aggregate measures (undo)
The default aggregation function of [sales, xxx] is SUM
If we want to change the default setting, go to [Sales] > Default Properties > Aggregation > xxx


16. Granularity
"Break your data point into small pieces"
Total = a * b * c * ...
