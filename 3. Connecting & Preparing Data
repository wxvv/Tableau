19.                LIVE vs EXTRACT
                  1 can | 2 cans
when #s must be correct | #s are not so important


20. Live vs Extract Practice
the extension of an extracted file is .hyper


21. To save a data source:
Double click data > Add to saved data sources > xxx.tds or the other one > Then it'll appear on the start page
 
All extensions:
project without data : .twb                                  with data : .twbx 
directory of data source + modification without data: .tds   with data: .tdsx   （calculated fields）
extract: .hyper
            
            
22. Union
Need same # of columns and same column names and same data types
There will be 1+ question about union: sales for 2018 and 2019, DON'T FORGET TO UNION THE TABLES!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forget where I was the last time, so I'll ignore the number and just start from whatever session I have for now

# Join
Choose your priority; left (outer) join, right (outer) join; no-matches remain NULL; inner join, only matched rowsross

# Cross database join:
Connect to different datasources first; primary is blue, secondary is orange

# Blending
Similar to join, but becomes useful if:
  cross database join isn't supported (Google Analytics);
  tables are at different level of detail: first is at order level, second is at daily level;
  join creates duplicate data or data cleaning is required;
  if you have a lot of data, joins take much time
1 or 2 theoretical questions about blending, may not be hands-on
Data > Edit relationships > Custom your relationship...
## Make sure to watch this part one more time

# Manage Data
To better arrange columns: right click name > split(custom split)
Right click > Default properties > then change whatever you want
Right click > Aliases > Change name here? 

## ALIASES: like alternative names for the members in a dimension
   CANNOT BE CREATED FOR CONT. DIMENSIONS, DATES, AND MEASURES
