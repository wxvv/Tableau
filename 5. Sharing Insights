# In exam, only need to find numbers / values

Things to consider: Who's the audience? Same perspective? Use metrics that target audience can understand.
Don't overload into 1 dashboard; <= 5 in one dashboard. 
Limit numbers of colors. 
Decide the main purpose of the dashboard, then put the most imp't thing on the upper left corner.

To arrange dashboard: in legend > fit > fit entire view (or others)

To create a relationship btw worksheet and url:
  dashboard > actions > add action: go to URL
  when using a button: hold ALT to directly go back
  choose FLOATING to put worksheets wherever you want
